use the npm install react-native-chart-kit react-native-svg

I used the Github Copilot to help me generate the basic template for a bar chart component.
The prompt that I used was to create a react navtive component that renders a bar chart using the chart kit.
The github copilot help me with showing me a starting point for a bar chart.

What the copilot suggested for me was to create a list for Labels and datasets but I rejected it and went with using the object.keys on the labels.

Copilot saved me time with the initial chart setup and the basic structure of the BarChart component.
